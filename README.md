## About CSS

Onsen UI bundles `css/onsen-css-components.css` wich can be directly included in an app. However, this example uses the source `css-components-src/src/onsen-css-components.css` where colors can be easily modified. In order to support this, [`postcss-cssnext`](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext) must be used in Webpack.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
